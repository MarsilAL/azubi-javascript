- write a function in three different programming languages that returns the sum of two numbers, which have been given to the function as an argument.
Java

public class culM {
    public static viod main (String[] args) {

        int num1 = 5;
        int num2 = 4;
        int sum;

        system.out.println("result is:"+sum)
    }
}

python

- explain variable shadowing. Give me an example!
