1- String
2- Number
3- Boolean
4- Null
5- Undefined
6- Symbol
7- BigInt
8- Object
9- Function
____________
1- String:

In JavaScript, there are 3 types of quotes.

Double quotes: "Hello".
Single quotes: 'Hello'.
Backticks: `Hello`.
Double and single quotes are “simple” quotes. There’s practically no difference between them in JavaScript.

Backticks are “extended functionality” quotes. They allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in ${…}


2- Numbers:

The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.

There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication *, division /, addition +, subtraction -, and so on.

Besides regular numbers, there are so-called “special numeric values” which also belong to this data type: Infinity, -Infinity and NaN.

3- Boolean:

The boolean type has only two values: true and false.


4- Null:

It’s just a special value which represents “nothing”, “empty” or “value unknown”.



5- Undefined:

The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”.
 declared, but not assigned.


6- Symbol:

!!!
A Symbol is a unique and immutable primitive value and may be used as the key of an Object property.
!!!


7- BigInt:
for really big numbers
for integer values larger than 2(53) or less than -2(53)


8- Object:

All other types are called “primitive” because their values can contain only a single thing (be it a string or a number or whatever). In contrast, objects are used to store collections of data and more complex entities.





B- what does coersion mean? Give me an example!
